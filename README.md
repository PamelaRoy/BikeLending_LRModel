# Project Name
> Bike Lending Company – Linear Regression assignment

BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. 
The company wants to know:
	-Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	-How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
Using the data provided design a model to identify : 
	-Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
	-How well those variables describe the bike demands

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
The top 3 features contributing to the demand of shared bikes are –
•	atemp ( feeling temperature in Celsius)
•	yr (year)
•	weathersit – 3 (Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds)

- Google Colab is used to do the coding
- Google Drive is used  to store the data file
- Important libraries used are 
 	- pandas
	- numpy 
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- sklearn 
	- statsmodel
